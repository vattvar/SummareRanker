In her first sitting for a magazine, the duchess is seen looking relaxed and wearing casual clothes.
The shoot was in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, where two images are being displayed in the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibition.

"Chris Poole - known as ""moot"" online - created the site in 2003.
It has gone on to be closely associated with offensive and often illegal activity, including instances where the images of child abuse were shared.
It was widely credited as being the first place where leaked images of nude celebrities were posted following 2014's well-publicised security breach affecting Apple's iCloud service. That incident prompted a policy change on the site.
However, 4chan has also been the rallying point for many instances of online activism from the likes of Anonymous, the loosely organized hacktivism group.
Mr Poole shared news of his new position on blogging site Tumblr.
""When meeting with current and former Googlers, I continually find myself drawn to their intelligence, passion, and enthusiasm - as well as a universal desire to share it with others.""
""I'm also impressed by Google's commitment to enabling these same talented people to tackle some of the world's most interesting and important problems.
He added: ""I can't wait to contribute my own experience from a dozen years of building online communities, and to begin the next chapter of my career at such an incredible company.""
Mr Poole stepped down as the administrator of 4chan in January 2015. Now he is expected to turn his attentions to Google's social networking efforts.
His arrival was welcomed by Bradley Horowitz, the head of ""streams, photos and sharing"" at the search giant's floundering social network, Google+.
""I'm thrilled he's joining our team here at Google,"" Mr Horowitz said.

"Barca will be investigated for alleged misappropriation of funds in the £48.6m (57m euros) deal with Santos.
The signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries
Rosell, speaking at a news conference after a Barca board meeting, insisted he had ""acted correctly"".
Vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu now takes over from the 49-year-old Rosell, who came to power in 2010.
Rosell's future has been a real source of concern ever since a Spanish national court judge accepted a lawsuit this week from Barcelona club member Jordi Cases, who alleged that the amount paid for Neymar was more than the reported fee.
Rosell maintains the accusation is ""unfair and reckless"".
He added: ""For some time, my family and myself have suffered threats and attacks in silence. These threats and attacks have made me wonder if being president means having to jeopardise my family.
""From the beginning, I have said the signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries.""
Rosell said he was resigning to spare the club's board of directors from ""unfair attacks"" that could ""negatively affect their management or the image of the club"".
He added: ""It has been an honour to serve the Barcelonistas. It's been a privilege to be the president of FC Barcelona.""
Rosell was named Barca president in the summer of 2010 after winning a landslide vote to succeed Joan Laporta, earning 61.34% of a record turn-out of 57,088 voters.

"The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead.
The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an average salary of £28,000.
The government said London was the highest funded part of the country.
It added that under the plans, which are under consultation, inner-city schools would be allocated 30% more money per pupil than the national average.
But London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs and the City, said no school would gain enough funding from the NFF to compensate for increased cost pressures from inflation, higher pension contributions and national insurance.
Ministers said the new formula was needed to tackle uneven levels of funding across England, with the best funded areas getting more than £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded averaging £4,200.
It said the funding cut was on top of National Audit Office figures which showed England schools faced an eight per cent real-terms cut per pupil by 2019-20 because it  wider cost pressures.
In a statement, London Councils said: ""At a time when UK schools are seen as underperforming by international standards, and when businesses based in London are facing massive uncertainty about recruiting skilled staff, there is an urgent need to invest in schools in London and across the rest of the country.""
It added: ""Without the right qualifications and skills, London's children will be unable to access jobs and contribute to the national economy.

"Ms Kendall told the BBC Labour risked sending a ""resignation letter to the British people as a serious party of government"" by electing Mr Corbyn.
Separately, Ms Cooper warned there was a ""serious risk the party will split"" if the left-winger becomes its leader.
It comes as Labour begins sending out the first ballot papers to voters.
The result of the contest will be announced at a special conference on 12 September.
More than 600,000 people have signed up to vote in the four-way contest but Labour has said applications are still being verified.

Meanwhile voting in the election for the new Scottish Labour leader ended at midday.
Mr Corbyn is due to unveil a 10-point policy plan while in Glasgow later.
The popularity of the left-wing Islington North MP, who is promising ""a new kind of politics"", has sparked a row about the future direction of the Labour party.
Another leadership contender, Andy Burnham, told the BBC Mr Corbyn's policies ""lack credibility"".
""It's not possible to promise free university education, re-nationalising the utilities, without that coming at a great cost and if you can't explain how that is going to be paid for then I don't think we'll win back the trust of voters on the economy,"" he said.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there had been ""frustration"" in rival camps who accused Mr Burnham of being reluctant to take on Mr Corbyn. This appeared to be his most direct attack yet, he added.
But in an interview with Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2, Mr Burnham declined to follow Ms Kendall and Ms Cooper and advise his supporters not to back Mr Corbyn with their second and third preferences.
He added: ""People will say if they hear things like that, 'hang on, what do you believe?'""
In an interview with The Independent, Ms Kendall called for voters to mark Ms Cooper or Mr Burnham as second and third preferences, and avoid giving votes to Mr Corbyn.
""I have set out very clearly where I differ with all the candidates but our differences with Jeremy's kind of politics are far greater,"" said Ms Kendall.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said she ""can't pretend to be agnostic"" about a victory for Mr Corbyn, saying of the voting process: ""It is an alternative vote system and I want to urge party members to use all of their different preferences.
""I will be using my second and third preferences and I would urge others to do the same because I don't want to see our party go back to the politics of the '80s, just being a party of protest.""
The Leicester West MP also said she did not see the party splitting, as it did in the 1980s when Labour members formed the Social Democratic Party.
However, Ms Cooper told BBC 2's Newsnight: ""I think there is a serious risk that the party will split, will polarise and I cannot bear to see that happen because there is too much at stake.""
Asked in an interview with grassroots Labour website Labourlist whether voters should use their votes to try to prevent Mr Corbyn winning, she said: ""I think people should use all of their preferences.
""And I think the focus has to be how do we make sure we can win that election, and that's the most important thing - and I don't think Jeremy can do that.""
Mr Corbyn has warned against ""personal abuse"" in the campaign, saying he wants to focus on policy.
His policy programme includes a commitment to ""growth not austerity"", nationalising the railways and energy sector, and a plan for nuclear disarmament.
In an essay for the Fabian Society he also suggested Labour's new increased following should be more involved in the party and proposed a review of membership fees to make the party more ""inclusive"".
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is expected to join the debate over the leadership contest with a speech on Sunday, called ""power for a purpose - the future of the Labour Party"".
Lance Price, former director of communications for Labour, told the BBC the contest had been an ""unedifying mess"" and had ""done nothing to reengage the labour party with those millions of people who deserted it"".
The Guardian newspaper has endorsed Ms Cooper for the leadership while the Daily Mirror has given its backing to Mr Burnham, although the paper urged him to ""find a role"" in his team for Mr Corbyn, who it says has ""lit up the election campaign"".","['Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged supporters not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership contenders Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged supporters not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged party members not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership candidates Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged supporters not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged voters not to back Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership contenders Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged party members not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged their supporters not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership contenders Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged voters not to back Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership candidates Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged party members not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged supporters not to back Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership rivals Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged supporters not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged members not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership contenders Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged supporters not to back Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership candidates Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged voters not to back Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Labour leadership candidates Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have urged supporters not to back Jeremy Corbyn.']",Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have said their supporters should back anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn in the contest.
"The Association of School and College Leaders says England's schools have had to make more than £1bn savings this year, rising to £3bn by 2020.
The government says school funding is at a record £40bn, with rises ahead.
Education Secretary Justine Greening will hear heads' cash grievances at Friday's ASCL conference in Birmingham.
She is due to address the union, which has published a survey of its members on the issue.
It suggests schools are finding it difficult to make savings without cutting provision and that things are predicted to get worse over the next two years.
Cost pressures are rising as greater pay, pension and national insurance costs are having to be covered from school budgets.
ASCL complains a new funding formula for schools has reduced the basic level of school funding going forwards by too much.
The meeting comes two days after requests for more money to spend on daily school costs were ignored by the chancellor in the Budget.
Philip Hammond however did pledge £500m for school buildings, mainly new free schools - some of which could be grammar schools.
One respondent said his school was moving to a ""bare bones education"", in which ""the components that make education special and enjoyable are being eroded away"".
Some 95% of the 1,054 heads, deputies and senior teachers responding to the survey said they had cut back on support services - including equipment and materials, as well as mental health and special needs support.
More than eight out of 10 said class sizes had increased - a claim strongly refuted by the Department for Education.
And more than two-thirds said they had cut back on activities like clubs and trips.
Just under three-quarters of respondents with GCSE-level classes said they had cut courses and just over three-quarters of heads with A-level students said they had also reduced subjects.
Foreign modern languages, music, arts and drama were among subjects removed at A-level.
Another said: ""Through no fault of their own, students will have restricted subject choices, in larger class sizes with less pastoral support, whilst still being expected to perform at the highest of standards - nonsense!""
One head said his school may have to axe its sixth form provision for next year and another said his school was starting to ""creak"" with all staff working to full capacity.
Interim general secretary, Malcolm Trobe, said: ""School leaders will do their utmost to protect provision, as they always do, but they cannot provide everything that is asked of them without the resources they need.
""Unless the government invests more in the education system, there will be a significant impact on the lives and life chances of young people.""
A spokesman for the DfE said: ""As this week's Budget demonstrates, the government is determined to ensure every child has access to a good school place and is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential.
""The government has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17 - and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years, to £42bn by 2019-20.""","['Head teachers are calling for more money from the government to help them cope with rising costs.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on supporting pupils with special needs, head teachers say.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on supporting pupils with special needs, head teachers are warning.', 'Head teachers are calling for more money from the government to help them cope with rising costs and cuts in funding.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on supporting pupils with special needs and disabilities, head teachers say.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on the basics that make education special, head teachers say.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on the basics that make education special, head teachers are warning.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on supporting pupils with special needs and disabilities, head teachers are warning.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on supporting pupils with special needs, heads say.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on the basics of education, head teachers are warning.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on the basics of education, head teachers say.', 'Head teachers are calling for more money from the government, saying schools are having to cut back on subjects, activities and support services.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on supporting pupils with special needs, head teachers warn.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on supporting pupils with special needs, heads are warning.', 'Too much money is being spent on ""shiny new school buildings"" and not enough on the basics that make education special and enjoyable, head teachers say.']","Head teachers say they are axing GCSE and A-level subjects, increasing class sizes and cutting support services as they struggle with school funding."

"Ann Barnes dealt with an ""ill-advised"" TV documentary, a probe into her car insurance, and youth commissioners who both had to step away from their role.
But she said she judged her time as PCC as a success.
She said Kent Police was now target-free, provided quality service and put victims at the heart of its work.
""Apart from one or two things I'd rather not have happened, I've really, really had a good time,"" she said.
Referring to incidents that led to adverse headlines, she said: ""You have to accept what life throws at you and deal with it.""
Mrs Barnes, who is not standing for re-election, said the Kent force was recognised nationally after latest HMIC reports.
""[Kent Police] genuinely puts victims at the heart of what it does. There are no targets, people don't chase targets. They just look to do a quality service,"" she said.
On her youth commissioner appointments, Mrs Barnes said: ""You can't interview for the unexpected.""
Kent's first youth commissioner Paris Brown resigned over comments she had posted on Twitter, and Kerry Boyd had to stop public engagements while reports of a relationship were investigated.
Mrs Barnes said Ms Brown handled things well after making mistakes when younger, and Ms Boyd did a good job and could have continued but turned down an extended contract.
After Ms Boyd left, the youth commissioner was not replaced.
Mrs Barnes said she was most proud of Kent Police's ""open and transparent"" culture.
And she said a new victim centre was providing ""a wraparound service"" to victims and witnesses, and she believed it would become a blueprint for delivering victims' services.

"Taylor, 25, joined County in May from Macclesfield, but has yet to start in the league.
The move has left Newport with only one goalkeeper in Joe Day, but manager John Sheridan is confident he will quickly fill the vacancy.
""Rhys is too good a goalkeeper to be kept on the bench and not playing football,"" said Sheridan.
""Financially it might enable me to bring someone else in, to try and fill in a different area.""
On Saturday Newport host fourth-placed Northampton Town hoping to win their third game in a row for the first time since last December, 2014.
The Exiles are also seeking their first home win since March.
Taylor's move means County are currently without a second goalkeeper.
Sheridan added: ""Rhys' move to Wrexham happened quickly... but we'll definitely have a keeper by the middle of next week.
""It's only one game. I'm not really worried.""
Sheridan also confirmed that defender Janoi Donacien has extended his loan spell from Aston Villa until January.
Donacien has featured in all four games since the Irishman replaced Terry Butcher as manager at the beginning of October.

"The Derbyshire club, who play in the eighth-tier Northern Premier League Division One North, have lost all 19 league and cup games this season.
New Mills have conceded 68 goals while three managers have left since June.
""It's tough but we've got a new squad and the players are starting to gel,"" Millers boss Garry Brown told BBC Radio 5 live's Non League Football Show.
Former Norwich City midfielder Keith Briggs took over from Roy Soule, who stepped down in June, but resigned after just 23 days for a job with Sheffield United's academy.
Andy Fearn was put in charge in July and appointed former Manchester City striker Shaun Goater as his assistant.
But Fearn and Goater lasted just nine league and cup games before resigning after a 7-1 home defeat to Prescot Cables.
Brown, who has overseen 10 league and cup defeats, added: ""There's been a lot of changes to the squad and there's only three players still here from when we took over in September.
""There's no budget, it's petrol money these lads are playing for.""
All is not lost for the Millers, who are bottom of the table, 10 points behind Harrogate Railway Athletic, the next team above them.
Brown, along with Paul Williams (his assistant at New Mills) and Lee Gregory, last season led Manchester team Wythenshawe Town to an astonishing 39 wins from 39 games played.
Bashley, who play in the Southern League Division One South & West, are also without a point after losing all 14 league games this season.

"The referendum will take place on 10 March, but Bath Conservative MP Ben Howlett said he was concerned about a ""lack of awareness"" about the issue.
Mr Howlett also said he is worried about the public's level of engagement.
Bath and North East Somerset Council said the referendum had been publicised in press releases and tweets.
It also said it was the subject of a two-page article in the winter edition of the council magazine which was distributed to all households in the region.
A further news release and polling cards will also be sent out to all households this week, the authority added.
Supporters of the referendum say Bath needs a mayor to give local government more visibility.
Directly elected mayors were created by the Local Government Act 2000 as one option for local government, as long as the idea was backed in a referendum.
Mr Howlett said he was ""personally concerned"" that an elected mayor was not appropriate for an area ""as diverse"" as Bath and North East Somerset, and that it could ""lead to an increase in the cost of local politics"".
""The level of misinformation on this issue is worrying - many people seem to still believe this is about a mayor of Bath and not understanding it would cover all of Bath and North East Somerset.

"More than a dozen men stormed into the Kiwi cafe in the Georgian capital on Sunday evening, the cafe said, shouting and throwing meat at patrons.
A brawl erupted but the attackers fled before police arrived.
Police are now investigating, and say they have questioned the attackers and cafe staff. Nobody has been arrested.
The cafe has appealed for public support, saying it was no prank but a case of intimidation by neo-Nazis.
The attackers wore strings of sausages round their necks and threw chunks of meat onto customers' plates, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports from Tbilisi.
They are known as the Bergmann group, and a social media page shows their attacks on people of Arab or African origin, our correspondent reports. One photograph shows members making the Nazi salute.
The Kiwi cafe is in a traditional part of old Tbilisi, and is popular among young people sporting unconventional hairstyles, tattoos and body piercings.
Most Georgians are Orthodox Christians and many see unorthodox lifestyles as a corrupting influence from the West.
The cafe said it had drawn some local hostility because of ""the way we look, music that we listen to, ideas we support, and the fact that we don't eat meat"" and backing of causes such as rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.
""During these hard times you can support us just by visiting our cafe, we will be very grateful if you come to show everyone that here are a lot of us who care about the issue!"" the Kiwi cafe said in a statement on Facebook.
It later told the BBC it had received strong messages of solidarity - from Georgia and abroad - but that people had also left angry comments trying ""to defend those fascists"".
It said it was also appealing for financial contributions to install security cameras in case of repeat incidents.
The incident comes amid growing concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Georgia.
Last week, hundreds of nationalists marched through central Tbilisi - waving Georgian flags and anti-communist banners, reports said - to mark independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Homophobia is also commonplace in Georgia, correspondents say. The country made world headlines in 2013 when a small group of LGBT activists were attacked by a large mob led by an orthodox priest.
The cafe statement blames Sunday's incident on the group of men who came into the premises, talking loudly, throwing meat and smoking, and then ""yelling, laughing, and talking to us sarcastically"".
These people ""were neo-Nazis... who support fascist ideas"", the cafe said.
Some minor injuries were sustained.
The police arrived only after the attackers had left, but the cafe said even some of those officers behaved aggressively, ""yelled with anger, said that we are guilty of what had happened"".","['A popular Tbilisi cafe says it has been attacked by far-right neo-Nazis.', 'A popular cafe in Tbilisi says it has been attacked by far-right neo-Nazis.', 'A popular Tbilisi cafe says it has been attacked by a group of far-right neo-Nazis.', 'A popular cafe in Tbilisi says it has been attacked by a group of far-right neo-Nazis.', 'A popular Tbilisi cafe has blamed neo-Nazis for an attack on its customers.', 'A popular cafe in Tbilisi says it has been attacked by a group of neo-Nazis.', 'A popular Tbilisi cafe says it has been attacked by a group of neo-Nazis.', 'A popular cafe in Tbilisi has blamed neo-Nazis for an attack on its customers.', 'A popular Tbilisi cafe says it has been attacked by far-right neo-Nazis who threatened staff and customers.', 'A popular cafe in Tbilisi says it has been attacked by far-right neo-Nazis who threatened staff and customers.', 'A popular cafe in Tbilisi says it has been attacked by far-right neo-Nazis who threw meat at customers.', 'A popular Tbilisi cafe says it has been attacked by a group of far-right neo-Nazis who threatened staff and customers.', 'A popular Tbilisi cafe says it has been attacked by a group of far-right neo-Nazis who threw meat at customers.', 'A popular cafe in Tbilisi says it has been attacked by a group of far-right neo-Nazis who threw meat at customers.', 'A popular cafe in Tbilisi says it has been attacked by a group of far-right neo-Nazis who threatened staff and customers.']",A vegan cafe in Tbilisi has appealed for public solidarity after being invaded by ultra-nationalists wielding grilled meat and sausages.
"The New Zealander made only one unenforced switch, bringing in Rhys Webb for Gareth Davies at scrum-half.
Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Alex Cuthbert miss out with injuries.
""We wanted to give the players a chance to sort of put behind us a disappointing first half from last week,"" said Gatland.
Flanker Justin Tipuric, second row Luke Charteris and Hallam Amos are drafted in to the team in place of the injured players.
Dan Lydiate will captain the side in the absence of Warburton and regular stand-in Jones.
Gatland said he had shown faith in players who had performed well in earlier matches, a fact he acknowledged was hard on hooker Ken Owens who makes his fourth appearance on the bench in this Six Nations championship.
""He's unlucky, really unlucky,"" he added.
""We felt that [hooker] Scott Baldwin has gone pretty well throughout the campaign.

Wales have been buoyed by the success of Arsenal midfielder Ramsey and Real Madrid forward Bale in 2016 as they reached the semi-finals of the European Championships, their first international tournament for 58 years.
Bradshaw, who has scored three goals in 19 appearances for the Tykes this season, puts the success of the pair down to two factors.
""You watch them train and you watch them play and you try to pick their brains about how they managed to get to that level,"" he said.
""A lot of it is natural ability and natural talent, but the thing that strikes me is their hunger; their hunger to want to improve even though Gareth's playing for Real Madrid and he's a massive part of his country's team.""
Bradshaw says he was ""gutted"" to miss out on Wales' memorable Euro 2016 campaign after a calf injury ruled him out of contention.
The former Aberystwyth Town player has since concentrated on boosting his future Wales hopes by performing well for his new club Barnsley.
""It was incredibly frustrating, with hindsight as well, at how well the lads did,"" he said.
""I was incredibly proud of the boys and how impressive they were at the Euros. I was gutted, but that's football. Unfortunately that was part and parcel of the game.
""But I picked my head up and managed to get a move to the Championship and I'm just trying to improve. It hurt for a while. It took for the majority of that summer for me to get over it.
""I was watching all the games and cheering the lads on from afar, but it was invaluable experience for me to go away to Portugal although I didn't manage to train that much because of the injury, it's all experience that I've enjoyed and hopefully I can put it into good use in the future and hopefully one day I'll get an opportunity again.""","['Barnsley striker Tom Bradshaw has praised the hunger of Wales team-mates Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale.

The offences heard at the High Court in Aberdeen happened in the Inverness and Dingwall areas between 1996 and 2004.
He sexually assaulted and attempted to rape the young girl and raped three women.
In his sentencing statement, Lord Uist said: ""You targeted vulnerable females in order to gratify your carnal lust.
""You have called all these women liars and shown no remorse for what you did.""
The judge added: ""It is clear to me that you have no respect for women and are a sexual fiend.""
Lord Uist said MacIntosh should not assume that he would be automatically released after having served 10 years in prison.
He said: ""You will be released only when the Parole Board for Scotland is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that you continue to be held in prison.""
Police Scotland has welcomed the life sentence.
Det Insp Eddie Ross said the case was brought to the attention of police by the NHS.
He said: ""During the investigation there was also significant involvement from the local authority in terms of housing and social work support for not only the victims but also their children.
""However, the most important people in all this are the victims and I must pay tribute to them in both coming forward to the police and staying with the prosecution process to conviction.
""I hope that this result will bring some comfort to the victims in this case and give confidence to anyone who has suffered similar experiences to come forward in the knowledge that their case will be sensitively and thoroughly investigated.""","['A man who raped and sexually assaulted three women and a young girl has been jailed for life.', 'A man who raped and sexually assaulted three women and a 13-year-old girl has been jailed for life.', 'A man who raped and sexually assaulted three women and a young girl in the Highlands has been jailed for life.', 'A man who raped and sexually assaulted three women and a girl has been jailed for life.', 'A man who raped and sexually assaulted three women and a girl in the Highlands has been jailed for life.', 'A man who sexually assaulted and attempted to rape a young girl and raped three women has been jailed for life.', 'A man who raped and sexually assaulted three women and a 13-year-old girl in the Highlands has been jailed for life.', 'A man who raped three women and sexually assaulted a young girl has been jailed for life.', 'A man has been jailed for life for raping and sexually assaulting three women and a young girl.', 'A man has been jailed for life for raping and attempting to rape a young girl and three women.', 'A man has been jailed for life for raping and sexually assaulting three women and a young girl in the Highlands.', 'A man has been jailed for life after being found guilty of raping and sexually assaulting three women and a young girl.', 'A man has been jailed for life for raping and sexually assaulting three women and a girl.', 'A man has been jailed for life for raping three women and attempting to rape a young girl.', 'A man who raped and sexually assaulted three women and a 13-year-old girl has been given a life sentence.']",A man who attempted to rape a young girl and raped three women has been jailed for life.
"A spokesman for the governor in Nangahar province said an Afghan commando had opened fire on the US troops during a joint operation in Achin. He was shot dead in return fire.
Another US soldier was reportedly wounded in the attack.
A spokesman for the Taliban said it had carried out the attack.
Islamic State militants also operate in the area.
Earlier, at least two Afghan policemen were killed by US forces in a so-called friendly fire incident in southern Afghanistan.
The deaths are said to have occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation in the restive province of Helmand.
It is reported to be the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned there in May.
Taliban insurgents have made widespread gains in the province.
In a statement, the US military apologised for the incident and said that an investigation had been launched.
It happened as police were on patrol in volatile Nad Ali district. The dead were members of the Afghan Border Police.
Afghan officials told AFP news agency that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack. They say a number of militants were also killed in the strike.
In recent months, the Taliban have captured several districts in Helmand and put provincial capital Lashkar Gah under pressure.
The arrival of hundreds of US Marines - following the withdrawal of US troops three years ago - is part of the Nato-led effort to train and assist Afghan forces. They include special forces who conduct separate counter-terrorism operations.
Air strikes by US warplanes have risen significantly over the last few months as President Donald Trump and other foreign leaders come under pressure to commit more troops.

"Cathay is one of the world's biggest cargo airlines, and its decision is expected to have a sizeable impact.
Previously, the airline had said it would only transport shark fin that was sustainably sourced.
Shark fin is considered a delicacy in Chinese cuisine and is often served as a soup at upmarket banquets.
More than 70 million sharks are killed every year, according to WWF figures. Large numbers are exported to Hong Kong, where they are consumed or further exported to mainland China.
""On the issue of shark's fin, with immediate effect we are happy to agree to ban the carriage,"" Cathay Pacific said in a statement on Wednesday.
It said it had not approved any shark fin shipments over the last year, pointing out that it had turned down 15 shipment requests for shark-related products.
Early reports said the ban extended to all shark products on cargo and passenger flights, but the airline told the BBC it currently applied to shark fin only,
Cathay said it would continue to review its policy.
Marine conservationists hailed Cathay's decision, with one proclaiming that it would make Hong Kong ""proud"".
""More Hong Kong businesses need to follow the lead,"" Hong Kong-based conservationist Sharon Kwok told AFP.
Government data cited by the South China Morning Post shows that shark fin imports to Hong Kong dropped by 42% between 2010 and 2015 to 5,717 tonnes.
During this period there was also a significant decline in imports by air.

"The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys ahead of a multi-billion euro tunnel project.
The axe seems to have been jammed into what was once the seabed, perhaps as part of a ritual offering.
The lack of oxygen in the clay ground helped preserve the wooden handle.
The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link.
""Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing,"" said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark.
Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations.
These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts.
Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests.
The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area.
Earlier this month, archaeologists working on the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel scheme announced that they had uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints along the edge of an ancient fish trap excavated at Rodbyhavn.","[""Archaeologists in Denmark say they have unearthed one of Europe's oldest axe handles."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark say they have unearthed the world's oldest well-preserved axe."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark say they have unearthed one of the world's oldest axe handles."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have unearthed what they say is Europe's oldest well-preserved axe."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have unearthed what they say is Europe's oldest intact axe."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have unearthed one of the world's oldest axe handles."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have unearthed what they say is one of Europe's oldest axe handles."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have unearthed what they say is one of the world's well preserved axe handles."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark say they have unearthed one of the world's best preserved axes."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have unearthed what they say is Europe's oldest axe."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark say they have unearthed one of the world's well preserved axe handles."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have discovered what they say is one of Europe's oldest axe handles."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have unearthed what they say is one of the world's oldest axe handles."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have discovered what they say is one of the world's well preserved axe handles."", ""Archaeologists in Denmark have unearthed what they say is one of the world's best preserved axe handles.""]",Archaeologists in Denmark have uncovered an incredibly rare find: a stone age axe held within its wooden handle.
"Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone.
But last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood.
Forestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting.
You can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist.
Aspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.
That's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens.
The last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago.
So Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.
Not all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.
The idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.
Well this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.
Robert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.
It's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.
Can we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?
Well yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.
Those branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.
It's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.
The trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.
Meaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.
The only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.
Fingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!","[""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the UK."", ""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most spectacular native trees in the UK."", ""I'm a huge fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the UK."", ""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the UK and it's also one of the most productive."", ""I'm a huge fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the UK and it's also one of the most productive."", ""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most spectacular native trees in the UK and it's also one of the most productive."", ""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the world and it's also one of the most productive."", ""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the UK and it's also one of the most important."", ""I'm a huge fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the world and it's also one of the most productive."", ""I'm a huge fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the UK and it's also one of the most important."", ""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most spectacular native trees in the UK and it's also one of the most important."", ""I'm a huge fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the world and it's also one of the most important."", ""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the world and it's also one of the most important."", ""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most spectacular native trees in the UK and it's also one of the easiest to plant."", ""I'm a big fan of the aspen tree, it's one of the most beautiful native trees in the UK and it's a great source of pollen.""]",Aspens are one of our most beautiful native trees and there's a huge demand for seeds to grow new ones for planting.
"The hyperbaric chamber, which treats divers with ""the bends"", was operated by St John's Ambulance on a donation basis until it broke in April 2014.
The health department replaced it in 2015, but says it needs to ""balance the books"".
Diving instructor Steve Bougourd said he was ""gobsmacked"".
""I'm just worried that this kind of cost will put people off of actually going to the [hospital] and notifying them if they suspect a problem,"" he said.
""We may find it's going to be very expensive to get out divers insured.""
In the UK hyperbaric oxygen treatment is covered by the NHS, but Guernsey has its own health care system.

He said the department would not make a profit from the new charges, which were based on ""the average usage that we could identify over the previous few years"".
In addition to paying for the training of staff and the maintenance of a 24 hour service, the department had to fund plans to buy its own chamber for about £250,000, Mr Freestone said.

Jews in the city of Ahmedabad, where the shop opened last month, said using the Nazi dictator's name was offensive. Israeli diplomats also raised the issue with the Gujarat state government.
The owners said they did not know who Adolf Hitler was when the shop opened.

He said officials had promised compensation for the rebranding of the store, which sells men's clothing, although he said they had provided nothing in writing.

"IS ""fired at everything that moved"" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says.
Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled.
IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa.
Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS ""caliphate"", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria.
""According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory.
He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey.
He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer.
The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes.
The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings.
Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms.
In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children.
Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town.
Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added.
Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months.
Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.","['Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, activists say.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the Syrian town of Kobane, activists say.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, activists say.', 'Islamic State militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, activists say.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in the northern Syrian town of Kobane, activists say.', 'Islamic State militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the Syrian town of Kobane, activists say.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, a monitoring group says.', 'Islamic State militants have killed 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, activists say.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed 120 civilians in and around the Syrian town of Kobane, activists say.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, a monitoring group says.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in the Syrian town of Kobane, near the Turkish border, activists say.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the Syrian town of Kobane, a monitoring group says.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, activists and residents say.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, reports say.', 'Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the Syrian town of Kobane, activists and residents say.']","Islamic State (IS) militants have killed more than 120 civilians since launching a fresh attack on the Syrian border town of Kobane, activists say."

"Energy Minister Fergus Ewing refused permission for the 21-turbine Rowantree development near Oxton last May.
He said the decision was based on ""unacceptable environmental impacts"".
RWE Innogy UK has submitted scoping plans to Scottish Borders Council for a wind farm of up to 11 turbines in the same location.
The proposed development on land north-east and east of Burnhouse Mains farmhouse, between Stow and Fountainhall, will be known as Longmuir Rigg wind farm.
A letter lodged with the council states that RWE's new plans for the site take into account the Scottish government's concerns about the Rowantree development.
In the correspondence, project manager Christopher McPake states: ""It has sought to reduce or negate the identified significant environmental effects of cumulative noise as well as effects upon landscape character and visual receptors.""

"The US Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period.
The rate was an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2%, which itself was an increase from the original reading of 0.7%.
However, it still marks a slowdown from the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew at a rate of 2.1%.
The latest growth figure was helped by an increased estimate for growth in consumer spending, which was revised up to a rate of 1.1% from 0.6%.
""The economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular pace,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services.
Growth estimates in the first quarter are often weak, a quirk some say is due to the difficulty of measuring the effect of seasonal changes.
Thursday's update bolsters the perspective of the Federal Reserve, which increased interest rates in June.
Policymakers at the time said they did not believe the slowdown in the first quarter was the start of a trend, pointing to one-off factors, including a relatively mild winter.
Stronger-than-expected trade figures published Wednesday also led some to predict better growth in the second quarter.
Even so, many say growth for the year is all but certain to fall short of the 3% goal outlined by US President Donald Trump. Mr Faucher forecasts growth around 2.2% for the year.
The International Monetary Fund this week cut its forecast for US economic growth, in part citing uncertainty over the chances for tax reform and infrastructure spending, policies that many say could provide an economic boost.","['The US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the first three months of the year.', 'The US economy grew faster than initially estimated in the first three months of the year.', 'The US economy grew faster than initially estimated in the first quarter of the year.', 'The US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the first quarter of the year.', 'The US economy grew at a faster pace than initially estimated in the first quarter of the year.', 'The US economy grew at a faster pace than initially estimated in the first three months of the year.', 'The US economy grew at a faster pace than previously estimated in the first quarter of the year.', 'The US economy grew at a faster pace in the first three months of the year than previously estimated.', 'The US economy grew at a faster pace than first estimated in the first quarter of the year.', 'The US economy grew at a faster pace than initially estimated in the first quarter of the year, official figures show.', 'The US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the first quarter of the year, official figures show.', 'The US economy grew faster than initially estimated in the first quarter of the year, according to official figures.', 'The US economy grew faster than initially estimated in the first quarter of the year, official figures show.', 'The US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the first three months of the year, official figures show.', 'The US economy grew faster than initially estimated in the first three months of the year, official figures show.']",The US economy grew at a faster pace than previously thought in the first three months of the year.

"Class-A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine were among the illegal substances seized, according to the data from police in England and Wales.
There were more than 2,000 incidents dating back to 2011, suggest figures from 34 police forces.
Teachers described the statistics as a ""worry"" and the ""tip of the iceberg"".
The figures were obtained by the Press Association news agency (PA) under the Freedom of Information Act.
PA sent Freedom of Information requests to every police force in England and Wales asking how many times illegal drugs had been seized or confiscated from school premises in the period from March 2011 to the end of 2014.
The query asked for details of the type and amount of drug involved, its value, the type of school (primary or secondary) and details of who it was seized or confiscated from.
Just over three-quarters of forces replied.
Of these, 28 forces gave details of the types of drugs involved, 18 forces identified the type of school and 13 the ages of the individuals involved.
The data reveals cannabis was involved in 625 of the cases and cocaine in 27.
Other drugs confiscated included LSD, amphetamines and ecstasy.
Overall there were two cases each of heroin possession at schools in the West Midlands, Surrey and Greater Manchester, plus another in Hertfordshire.
Only four incidents involved children under 11.
An eight-year-old and a nine-year-old in Staffordshire were caught with cannabis, as was a 10-year-old girl at a Leicester primary school, while another 10-year-old in Greater Manchester was carrying £5 worth of the drug.
There were 241 incidents involving 15- to 16-year-olds and 231 incidents involving 11- to 14-year-olds.
In Greater Manchester, a 14-year-old was caught with heroin with a street value of £500, and a 16-year-old with a quantity worth £330.
Other incidents involved parents or school employees, including a school gardener in Humberside and a cleaner at a Manchester primary.
The highest number of incidents and offences in the three complete years to March 2014 was for Hampshire with 229 cases.
There were 144 incidents in Avon and Somerset and 138 in the West Midlands.
South Wales police reported 92 cases.
There was a slight year-on-year decrease in the numbers which peaked at 657 in 2011-12 and fell to 611 and 560 in the next two years, while in the period March to December 2014, there were 407 incidents.
Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said any incident of drugs on school premises was ""worrying as it will often only be the tip of the iceberg of what young people are encountering on the streets.
""Teachers and school leaders are always alert to the potential for young people being involved in drug or alcohol abuse.""
Ms Keates said many specialist programmes to help schools support and educate young people about substance abuse had been cut in recent years.","['Children as young as eight were caught with drugs on school premises, figures show.', 'Children as young as eight have been caught with drugs on school premises, figures show.', 'Children as young as eight have been caught with drugs on school premises, figures suggest.', 'Children as young as eight were caught with drugs on school premises, figures suggest.', 'Children as young as eight were caught with drugs on school premises, figures reveal.', 'Children as young as eight have been caught with drugs on school premises, figures reveal.', 'Children as young as eight have been caught with illegal drugs on school premises, figures show.', 'Children as young as eight have been caught with illegal drugs on school premises, figures suggest.', 'Children as young as eight have been caught with illegal drugs on school premises, figures reveal.', 'A 10-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among hundreds of children caught with drugs at schools in the last three years.', 'A 10-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among children caught with drugs on school premises last year, figures show.', 'A 10-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among children caught with drugs on school premises last year.', 'A 10-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among children caught with drugs at schools last year, figures show.', 'A 10-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among hundreds of children caught with drugs at schools last year.', 'A 10-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among hundreds of children caught with drugs on school premises last year.']","Hundreds of schoolchildren, among them a pupil of only eight, have been caught with drugs on school premises, new figures reveal."

"Eighteen men, aged between 19 and 29 and some in prison, are banned from parts of Birmingham and must register phones and vehicles with police.
The two-year orders aim to disrupt gang-related violence between the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew.
West Midlands Police said it was ""a landmark ruling"".
The orders follow a spate of firearms offences in the city in 2015 and 2016, but the gangs have struck fear across parts of Birmingham for many years.
They gained notoriety in 2003 when their violent feud claimed the lives of two girls - Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis - outside a late-night new year party in the city. Four men were later jailed for life for their murders.
The gangs have also been behind countless drive-by shootings, drug dealing, intimidation, robberies and kidnappings.
After more recent incidents of gun crime in the city, West Midlands Police and the council sought to secure the injunctions in a civil case heard at Birmingham Crown Court earlier this year.
The force secured interim injunctions in 2016 and said at the time it did not want to identify anyone until they were permanent.  The BBC revealed their names after obtaining the county court documents.
More than 80 people from the Home Office and police gave evidence between February and June ahead of the orders being granted in July, which the force has revealed for the first time now.
Two have already been issued, three men are being sought by police and three properties were visited by officers on Wednesday.
The men are forbidden from associating with each other and entering the city centre, Handsworth, Newtown, Winson Green and Lozells.
In a copy of an injunction seen by the BBC, gang members are also banned from appearing in music videos that include material linked to the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. One such music video was shown during the court proceedings.
Ten other men will receive the orders in jail where restrictions will be imposed on certain visitors to limit any gang associations, police said.
Among those to be given the injunctions in prison are two men believed to have been the ""armed response"" faction of the Burger Bar Boys.
Reial Phillips, 21, from Winson Green was jailed for 27 years last year after seven people were injured in a series of shootings during a feud with members of the Johnson Crew.
His co-defendant 23-year-old Ashai Gray, from Walsall, was jailed for nine years after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin.
Police said their actions ""brought fear"" to people in the West Midlands.
Gang injunctions came into force in England and Wales in 2011. Home Office figures show that between January 2011 and January 2014, 88 had been put in place.
The first one issued in the West Midlands was in 2012.
But solicitor Errol Robinson, who represented two of the four men jailed for the new year murders, criticised the move.
""They don't change behaviour or address underlying issues,"" he said.
""Injunctions become a bit of a trophy and encourage rebellion. Gang members like to show that they're not listening to orders so will breach orders.
""It's a cheap way of trying to solve crime but there is no evidence to suggest that they work.
""They're just a cosmetic gesture to show people that something is being done about gangs - but actually the results are minimum to none.""
From former gang members the BBC has spoken to, there is little support for the mechanism, BBC Midlands Correspondent Sima Kotecha said.
She said a number of gang members had said that if a person is banned from going to a certain part of a city, they will just go somewhere else and find others who have the same goal of causing violence and disruption.
Birmingham has seen another spike in gun and knife crime in 2017, with nine fatal stabbings this year. None of the men named in the injunctions are involved, police said.
Det Sgt Ian Comfort said: ""This is relatively new legislation and we believe that securing final full injunctions on such a large number of gang members is a UK first.
""The injunctions are applied for in the civil court in addition to sentences handed out by the criminal court for offences. They are an additional measure to help control the offenders and keep the community safe.""
Supt Mat Shaer, neighbourhood policing superintendent for Birmingham, said the injunctions were ""not sought lightly"" and the police, council and other groups had already made ""exhaustive efforts with these men"" and their families to try and steer them away gang culture.
Organised gangs in Birmingham have been a part of the city's life since the 1870s. Some have been mythologised on TV such as the Peaky Blinders.
But today's gangs linked to guns and drugs are far from glamorous and bring terror and misery to many people's lives.
The names Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew sprang on to the crime scene in the late 1990s.
Chaotic and quick to wreak violence, their crimes reached a crescendo one night at a new year's party in 2003 when two innocent teenage girls, Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, died in a spray of machine gun fire in a drive-by shooting as members of the Burger Bar Boys attempted to kill a Johnson Crew man stood outside a Birmingham party.
That shocking display of gang callousness led to a concerted effort by government, police and the city council, and 10 years later it led some to believe that the gangs had been defeated as gun crime fell dramatically.
But in the last 18 months, a new generation of would-be gang members have arisen and shootings have begun to surge upwards.
Even in the last few weeks, the police have been shot at as they carried out an anti-gun operation in the Ladywood area of the city.

"Gary Haggarty, 44, is no longer to be prosecuted for three alleged offences.

"Mr Gargan, 48, was found guilty of eight charges of misconduct but has been allowed to return to work.
The Avon and Somerset branch of the federation said it ""cannot envisage"" how the public or police can have ""confidence in his leadership"".
Mr Gargan said he understood people had questions and said he would address these.
In a statement issued through the Chief Police Officers Staff Association, he said he was ""very much looking forward to returning to work"" and ""beginning the process of rebuilding confidence in the force"".
The comments about his return to work were made in an open letter to Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens.
Mr Gargan was suspended following allegations of data protection breaches and inappropriate behaviour with women.
A panel found him guilty of misconduct - but cleared him of gross misconduct. His suspension was lifted and a phased return to work prepared.
Mr Gargan said his actions had ""fallen below the standards expected of a chief constable"".
In the letter seen by the BBC, the Police Federation said the chief constable is ""the person that sets the standard of professional behaviour and ethical conduct"" and the role ""must be beyond reproach"" in the eyes of the public and police officers.
It said its officers had been asked on a daily basis by ""the communities they serve"" how the chief constable ""can return to work in these circumstances"".
The letter ends with the federation calling on the commissioner to ""show strong leadership in dealing with this issue"".
Some former members of the force have also criticised Mr Gargan's return.
One group of retired officers said the ""debacle"" had caused ""more pain and damage to morale than is imaginable"".
Lawrie Lewis, a retired Chief Superintendent, said the force's reputation had been ""severely tarnished"".
Sue Mountstevens said: ""The procedure to be followed in relation to the sanction hearing is strictly regulated.

"Michael Bryn Jones, 39, from Llandudno, disappeared on 3 April 2016 after going to the door of the Hergest psychiatric unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor.
He was found hanging in woodland on 21 June.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) said it has already changed its procedures.
An inquest into Mr Jones' death heard he had been a patient at the Hergest unit until a few days before his disappearance and continued to suffer anxiety and paranoia after he left hospital.
He turned up at the unit in the early hours of 3 April and was sent to the accident and emergency department but left without booking in or speaking to anyone.
Robat Hughes, the senior nurse who spoke to Mr Jones at the unit, told the inquest he regretted not asking him whether he was already having treatment.
""He came to the door and asked to see a doctor, but I said there was no doctor there as she'd gone home sick.  I said that if he went to accident and emergency then there were doctors there,"" he said.
""He was relaxed and calm.  I didn't know if he was using mental health services and I didn't ask.
""I should have asked if he'd been having treatment.  It has been something I've thought about a lot since.""
Dr Stuart Porter, a consultant psychiatrist who reviewed the incident, said: ""Somebody should have taken Michael Bryn Jones to accident and emergency.  It's also good practice to follow that up with a phone call.""
In a statement, BCUHB said it offered ""sincere condolences"" to Mr Jones' family and ""fully accepted"" the coroner's findings.
""We have carried out our own thorough investigation, in conjunction with Michael's family, and as a result we have made changes to service provision,"" it added.
Recording a conclusion of suicide, coroner Nicola Jones said: ""There should have been more effort to persuade [Mr Jones] to come into the Hergest unit for a full assessment of his condition.

"Wholesale prices have dropped and motoring organisations have suggested this merits reduced pump prices.
Tesco and Morrisons are cutting prices by 2p a litre on Friday, and Asda and Sainsbury's said they would reduce prices by up to 2p a litre on Saturday.
But drivers are being warned that prices can vary in different areas.
The average UK price for a litre of unleaded petrol was 118.83p on Thursday, and 120.88p for a litre of diesel, according to the latest figures from Experian Catalist.
Ten days earlier, the average unleaded price was 120p a litre, and diesel cost 122.06p.
The oil price and wholesale prices fell sharply at the start of March, and motoring organisations have argued that this should have been feeding through to another 2p cut per litre in prices at the pumps.
The RAC said motorists could feel ""aggrieved"" that prices had not fallen further, earlier.
Asda said it had dropped prices twice in two weeks, and had a national price cap to ensure motorists were dealt with equitably. Morrisons said it had also made a second cut in two weeks.
Tesco is dropping petrol and diesel prices by 2p a litre over the course of Friday afternoon at all its outlets, followed by Sainsbury's on Saturday.
Luke Bosdet, of the AA, said that there was general concern that so-called supermarket fuel price wars did not actually benefit all drivers across the country.
He claimed prices fell the most in areas where there were a range of supermarkets located close to each other. In other areas with less competition, the same cuts were not as likely to be seen.
""We would urge motorists to look around to find a better price. There are petrol price apps that can help,"" he said.","[""Four of the UK's biggest supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices."", 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time in two weeks.', 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the second time in two weeks.', ""Five of the UK's biggest supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices."", 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time in three weeks.', 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time in a month.', 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time in more than a month.', ""Several of the UK's biggest supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices."", 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time since January.', 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time in more than two weeks.', 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time in four weeks.', 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time since February.', 'Several major supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices.', 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time in five weeks.', 'Supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices for the first time in more than two months.']",Motorists will see an acceleration in fuel price cuts over the weekend as supermarkets take up to 2p off a litre of petrol and diesel.
"More than 5,500 people signed a petition against plans to build a five-metre embankment along the waterfront.
However, the council has admitted that there will never be a consensus on any flood protection proposal.
A report to a meeting of Dumfries and Galloway Council's environment committee next week will attempt to find a way forward.
What's happening in Scotland? Keep in touch through our live page.
Chairman Colin Smyth said: ""What we are now able to do is focus on what I think is the biggest issue as far as the public is concerned. In the draft proposal, the height of the embankment and the walls were simply too high and the public did not support that.
""What we now need to do is make sure that we find a solution that deals with the flooding, regenerates the Whitesands, solves the car parking issues, but also reduces the height of any proposed flood protection scheme.""
Water from the River Nith regularly spills over into the Whitesands, flooding a major town centre car park and nearby business premises.
Campaigners against the Â£15m proposal to build an embankment claimed it would have a detrimental effect on the town's main beauty spots.
They also raised concerns that the move would lead to the loss of about 200 waterfront car parking spaces.
David Slater, a local businessman who has been one of the project's most vocal objectors, said: ""However many other consultations they do now, public opinion will not change at this stage.
""It will be interesting to see how they can agree with the public to reduce the height of the bunds. There has to be better ideas because we can't put that in our town.""

"The towns of Virginia Water and Cobham, in Surrey, have become Britain's first million pound towns - where average house prices are more than £1m.
Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire is also in the millionaire's club, according to research by Lloyds Bank.
They are the first towns outside London where prices have hit seven figures.
The research was based on data from the Land Registry for the first half of 2015.
Prices in Virginia Water - home to the likes of Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Bruce Forsyth - average no less than £1.169m, making it Britain's most expensive town outside the capital.
No wonder that the town's famous golf course, Wentworth, feels able to charge joining fees of £125,000. That is on top of the annual membership fee of £16,000.
Cobham - familiar to Chelsea footballers and their WAGS - has average prices of £1.043m.
And anyone wanting to buy in Beaconsfield can expect to pay £1.003m.
""We're seeing the emergence of towns where the average price is at least £1 million,"" said Sarah Deaves, private banking director at Lloyds Bank.
""Whilst there are several London neighbourhoods where prices are already at this elevated level, outside of the capital this is a first.""
However the figures also show a sharp slow-down in the number of homes sold for more than £1m.
In the first half of 2015 there were 5,599 such sales, down from 6,303 in 2014. That amounts to an 11% fall.
One reason for that is the change in Stamp Duty rates, introduced in December 2014.
The buyer of a £1m house will now pay £43,750 in Stamp Duty, up from £40,000 previously.","['Three towns outside London have hit £1m house prices.', 'Three towns outside London have hit £1m house prices, according to new research.', 'Three towns outside London have hit the £1m mark for house prices.', 'Three towns outside London have hit £1m house prices, according to new figures.', ""Three towns outside London have been named as Britain's most expensive places to buy a home."", 'Three towns outside London have become the most expensive in the UK, according to new research.', 'Three towns outside London have been named as the most expensive in the UK.', ""Three towns outside London have become Britain's most expensive places to buy a home."", 'Three towns outside London have hit £1m house prices, according to a new report.', 'Three towns outside London have become the most expensive in the UK.', ""Three towns outside London have become millionaire's villages, according to new research."", 'Three towns outside London have hit the £1m mark for house prices, according to new research.', 'Three towns outside London have become the most expensive in the UK, according to new figures.', ""Three towns outside London have become Britain's most expensive, according to new research."", 'Three towns outside London have hit the £1m mark in house prices.']","One has a golf course that charges £125,000 to become a member, and the other has a post office said to stock bottles of Bollinger and Dom Perignon."
